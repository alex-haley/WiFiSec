# v1.2:

## global fixes:
```
- now when you entering in placing mode you will always start from [1,1] coordinates;
- deleting routers: if you enter wrong router name the program will not crash;
- deleting routers: you can now enter '0' to quit deleting mode.
```

# v1.2a:

## minor fix:
```
- when power of signal from router is low than/or zero, it simply says that connection is out of bounds.
```

# v1.3:

## main function rework
```
- main menu have separate function call
- added try catch in main menu to catch wrong input
- so, if you input characters instead of integers, program will just abort instead of infinitely spamming in cli
```

## README edited
```
- section about `compiled version of program in repository` is deleted due to program rewok
