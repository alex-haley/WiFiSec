=============== WiFiSec ================

game where you place routers and calculate its signal strength.

nothing so interesting, but im stuck with calculating this signal strength for both X and Y directions, with was pretty tough
in version 1.0 i calculate signal strength with this formula:
1 - (sqrt(pow(xrouter-X) + pow(yrouter-Y)) / 8)
